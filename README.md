# Introduction :
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
Tkinter Python library is used to create the GUI. Two options are available to play the game, along with the system or with another player.

A small winning strategy is used to play with the system. The system will try to find the best place to put its naught or cross by which the system will win or try to stop players to win. 
# Approach:
1. Create a landing page containing selection buttons: Single-player or multiplayer.
2. Create a game board containing nine tiles to play the game along with other details (i.e. playing with a system or another player, whose turn etc.).
3. Allow the player to press the tile and check the status of the game (i.e. Tie game, any one of the players won the match or the game is still running).
4. Display the message, of who won the match.
# Output :
The Tic Tac Toe Game App will look like :
